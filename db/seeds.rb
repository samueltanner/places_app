# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Place.create(name: "White House", address: "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington DC 20500")
# Place.create(name: "Marks House", address: "915 1st Ave N, Apt. 3, Seattle, WA 98109")
# Place.create(name: "Harry Potter At The Dursly's", address: "#4 Privit Drive, Under the Stairs")
